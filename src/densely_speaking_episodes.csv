Her research contributes to our understanding of what drives the (unequal) distribution of people and economic activity across space, focusing on the role of transportation infrastructure and urban forms. Her 2023 paper, The (Express)Way to Segregation: Evidence from Chicago, examines the long-established view that highways acted to increase segregation. Did expressways increase racial segregation in urban centers? Professor Bagagli establishes that expressways contributed to racial segregation in Chicago through two channels: (1) local price and amenity effects and (2) barrier effects. From these findings, she then constructs a structural urban model to study the link between urban barriers and racial preferences in shaping the allocation of people across space.
